PART 1: Directions on using Webstorm.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them. Bold ONLY the glossary word. 

In order to use **GIT**, WebStrom, and **GitHub**, there are a few steps that need to be taken before commencing upcoming projects. 

Steps:

1. Download the corresponding WebStorm to your device through jetbrains.com. If you are a college student, you qualify to download WebStrom for free. 

2. After installing WebStorm, go to git-scm.com/downloads and install this program to your computer. **GIT** is recommended for a Windows device, Apple devices will experience a few complications throughout the download. 

3. After those two appilications are installed, create your free **GitHub** account. Use your college email to make the process more simpler and organized. 

4. Once your account is created, open up WebStorm and input your login information for **GitHub** into the corresponding boxes.

5. Once your account is synced with WebStrom, sync **GIT** to your application. To do this, click (Ctrl+Alt+S) on your keyboard, select System Prefrences > Version Control > **GIT** > Select **GIT** path "git.exe". 

6. After **Git** is properly programmed in WebStorm, **GitHub**'s password must be saved within the app. To do this, click (Ctrl+Alt+S), select System Prefrences > Appearance and Behavior > System Settings > Passwords > Ok. 

7. Once you click "Ok" input your **GitHub** password and click "Ok". 

8. After creating, installing, and programming your applications, go back to GitHub.com and next to your avator click on the + sign > New **Repository**. 

9. In the "**Repository** Name" box, add a name to your corresponding class and click Public > Create **Repository**. (Example: A03)

10. The **Repository** is now created in your **GitHub** account. Now we have to import it over to WebStrom. Open WebStrom and click "Get From VCS" > "**GitHub**" > "The name of your repository from **GitHub** > "**Clone**". 

11. Once your file is opened, click on "File" > "HTML" > "HTML 5" > "Input a name" > "Add". 

12. On the right corner of the program, click on the search icon and type "**Commit**". 

13. Once you click "**Commit**", a tab should open and there is a section that says "Comment Message". Click on the white box below and type "This is a base file" > **Commit**. There should be a green notification pop up on the right bottom of your screen indicating the following commit. 

14. Now in order to change the file to **remote repository**, click (Ctrl+Shift+K) > Select the name of your committed file > **Push**. 

15. Go back to GitHub.com and check your repository file. There should be a new a file indicating the transfer that you made from WebStrom to **GitHub**.

16. In order to view your website, click on Settings > scroll down to GitHub Pages > select master **branch** under source. 

17. If you tend to update future accommodations to your program, make sure to **fetch** the changes so your new installations can **merge** with the old ones. 

18. As well, if you need to adjust one **branch** use **pull** changes to make the adjustments. 

19. Be careful when you're merging your branches, there will be an error message and **GIT** will request a **merge conflicts**. 

20. Remember, the process may be long and difficult, but with practice, WebStorm will become more understanding.
